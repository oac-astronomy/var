NBS Assignment Senior Network Specialist 2021


Hi everyone,

There is my NBS Assignment so I would like to explain what I did.

Firstly, I created a program that lists environment variables the name on the pool is var and it is written in GO language. 
I tested it on my Kaly Desktop machine and it is working. 

Secondly, I moved the file var.go to my GitHub path to commit with GitHub Desktop. After checking all details about the path and setup, I commit to main. Besides, the GitHub repository on the web was updated. 

Finally, I wrote a brief explanation of how I did this process.
